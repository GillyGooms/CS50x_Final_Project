This is the project folder for my CS50x final project.

#### Description: This project aims to develop an IOS app using Swift.
The purpose of this project is to develop an IOS app using Swift that simulates a random generator. 
The random generator, in this iteration, show cases various shapes and states the name of them underneath.
This random generator can be later used to include names, terms, or any other image to word relation.
The development of this app is for two purposes: 
  1. Curiousity in how a random name wheel is developed and if it was possible to make my own.
  2. An app I can easily manipulate and use for studying, or while at work. I currently teach in a classroom and use this type of generator on a daily basis but always felt it lacked the "random" in random generator applications. Often times, students fall in the same order and it clearly shows a preference to certain colors on the wheel.
By developing my own random generator, I now gained conifdence witha new platform, and found a way to "look under the hood" of an application I use daily on my own.
In future iterations, I would like to add an option for students to input their own name to the wheel, and randomly assign an image to each student.
One thing of note for this project is that it uses a "button" feature and not only randomly generates the shapes, but also background colors. In addition, this app consists of smooth transitions that swipe through, which can be a fun feature for young children when seeing whos name may come up next.
